### Weather App

This repository contains a simple **JavaFX-Maven Weather App** that my two friends and I developed for our **Programming 3** course. We received a grade of **4** on this project.

## Important Note
The app will not display any weather data unless you provide a valid **API key** for the weather service.

## Features
- Fetches and displays real-time weather information
- Weather map
- Favorites
- History
- User-friendly JavaFX-based graphical interface
- Maven-powered modular structure for streamlined development and deployment
